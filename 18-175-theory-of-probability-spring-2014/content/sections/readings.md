This course will follow the textbook:

*   Durrett, Rick. _Probability: Theory and Examples_. 4th ed. Cambridge University Press, 2010. ISBN: 9780521765398. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=evbGTPhuvSoC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

I use the same notation as Durrett whenever possible.

In addition to the main textbook, there are many excellent textbooks and sets of lecture notes that cover the material of this course, several written by people right here at MIT. The course material is contained in the union of the following online texts for first-year graduate probability courses:

*   [S.R.S. Varadhan's lecture notes](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/varadhan/limittheorems.html)
*   ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Amir Dembo's lecture notes (PDF)](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~adembo/stat-310a/lnotes.pdf)
*   ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Rick Durrett's book at CiteSeer (PDF)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.155.4899&rep=rep1&type=pdf) or at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Probability-Cambridge-Statistical-Probabilistic-Mathematics/dp/0521765390/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346212856&sr=1-1) and here is a ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[recently updated version (PDF)](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/pte.html) from Durrett's web page.
*   [Noel Vaillant's www.probability.net tutorials](http://www.probability.net/)
*   [Dmitry Panchenko's notes for an earlier rendition of 18.175]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/lecture-slides).

For a more general analysis reference, there is also the online text [Applied Analysis by Hunter and Nachtergaele](http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/book/pdfbook.html).

Other excellent graduate probability books (that I don't think have been posted online, at least not by the authors) include (but are obviously not limited to):

*   Billingsley, Patrick. _Probability and Measure_. Anniv. ed. Wiley, 2012. ISBN: 9781118122372. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=a3gavZbxyJcC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Dudley, R. M. _Real Analysis and Probability_. Cambridge University Press, 2002. ISBN: 9780521007542. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=7UuT7UZViN0C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Stroock, Daniel. _Probability Theory: An Analytic View_. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, 2010. ISBN: 9780431087023. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=IvSSLeXpq3sC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]
*   Williams, David. _Probability with Martingales_. China Press, 2008. ISBN: 9787506292511.

There's a lot of overlap between these books, but you'll develop [strong opinions](http://xkcd.com/915/) if you spend much time with them. Here is one person's [rated list](http://www.amazon.com/lm/1F85VWNRTMY2T/ref=cm_pdp_lm_all_itms) of graduate probability books. (You probably won't agree with the list author's opinions, but it's still a nice list.)
